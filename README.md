### I'm Sepehr (Means the sky ‚òÅÔ∏è), a developer based in Turkey. I love learning new things and always curious about how things work and why they work this way. I liked computers since my childhood, and started programming from 2009 and continued it professionally since 2013. Since then, I've done so many small and big projects with many challenging things.

My current specializations and interests are in developing frontend and also backend of websites.

In frontend development, I've worked with ReactJS and have a good experience in creating PWAs and done a couple of successful PWA projects. When it comes to UI, I have meticulous attention to detail and possess curiosity, empathy, and passion. I even pay close attention to a single pixel on a webpage.

In backend development, I'm fluent in PHP and its related frameworks, especially Laravel. I've done many projects in PHP, mostly Laravel, and I can say I have a good experience in many concepts of it.
From 2014, I gathered experiences in Linux servers and configuring them, mainly Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian. Load Balancing, Nginx Caching, and MySQL clustering are the other skills that I have done in Linux.

In general, I always oblige myself to write the best practice and scalable code, so I enjoy what I do. üòá
